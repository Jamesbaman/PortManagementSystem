# PortManagementSystem
This program is used as an exercise for abstraction with classes and methods, and the use of data structures. <br>
It has two main classes (Container and Ship) and a main driver (PortManagementSystem) that applies stack and queue operations. <br>
This uses a console-based menu and applies basic operations, which are: <br>
Create – Add new containers (push to stack) and register new ships (enqueue to queue) <br>
Screenshot 1
Read – View all containers stored (stack, LIFO) and all ships waiting (queue, FIFO) <br>

Update – Load the top container onto the front ship, reducing both lists <br>

Delete – The program ends when the user chooses exit <br>
