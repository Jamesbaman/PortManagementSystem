# PortManagementSystem
This program is used as an exercise for abstraction with classes and methods, and the use of data structures.
It has two main classes (Container and Ship) and a main driver (PortManagementSystem) that applies stack and queue operations.
This uses a console-based menu and applies basic operations, which are:
Create – Add new containers (push to stack) and register new ships (enqueue to queue)
Screenshot 1
Read – View all containers stored (stack, LIFO) and all ships waiting (queue, FIFO)

Update – Load the top container onto the front ship, reducing both lists
